            <h3>Ozymandias</h3>
            <p>
                I met a traveller from an antique land,<br>
                Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone <br>
                Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,<br>
                Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br>
                And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>
                Tell that its sculptor well those passions read <br>
                Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br>
                The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br>
                And on the pedestal, these words appear: <br>
                My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;<br>
                Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!br
                Nothing beside remains. Round the decay <br>
                Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare <br>
                The lone and level sands stretch far away.” <br>

            <h3>The Road Not Taken</h3>
            <p>
                Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, <br>
                And sorry I could not travel both <br>
                And be one traveler, long I stood <br>
                And looked down one as far as I could <br>
                To where it bent in the undergrowth; <br>

                Then took the other, as just as fair, <br>
                And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
                Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
                Though as for that the passing there<br>
                Had worn them really about the same,<br>

                And both that morning equally lay<br>
                In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
                Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
                Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
                I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>

                I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
                Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
                Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—<br>
                I took the one less traveled by,<br>
                And that has made all the difference.<br>

            <h3>Do Not Stand At My Grave And Weep</h3>
            <p>
                Do not stand at my grave and weep<br>
                I am not there. I do not sleep.<br>
                I am a thousand winds that blow.<br>
                I am the diamond glints on snow.<br>
                I am the sunlight on ripened grain.<br>
                I am the gentle autumn rain.<br>
                When you awaken in the morning's hush<br>
                I am the swift uplifting rush<br>
                Of quiet birds in circled flight.<br>
                I am the soft stars that shine at night.<br>
                Do not stand at my grave and cry;<br>
                I am not there. I did not die.<br>
